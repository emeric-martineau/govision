# GoVision

Text User Interface inspired by TurboVision and Windows writing in pure GO build
on top of great [TCell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) library.

GoVision works by message.

## Why another library ?

Mmm... good question. When I was young, I'm fan of Borland TurboPascal and
[TurboVision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) and
[Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic) 1.0 for MS-DOS.

I'm also love how Windows works for GUI, by using message.
